Static Twitter Homepage Replica

This static webpage resembles the homepage layout of a social media platform like Twitter. It utilizes HTML and CSS to achieve a  visual representation of the following elements:

Top Navigation Bar: A bar at the top likely containing profile picture, username, search bar, and navigation icons.
Left Navigation Panel: A panel on the left containing options like “Explore,” trending topics, and who to follow.
Main Content Area: A central area showcasing tweets in a list format. Each tweet displays a profile picture, username, tweet content, and icons for replies, retweets, likes, and bookmarks.
Right Panel: A panel on the right that might show who to follow suggestions.
Limitations:

Remember that this is a static mock-up. It cannot perform actions or functionalities  like a real social media platform. Features like creating posts,  liking and retweeting, and real-time updates require additional programming languages like JavaScript.
